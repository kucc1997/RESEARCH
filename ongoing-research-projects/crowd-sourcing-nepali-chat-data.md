# Crowd Sourcing Nepali Chat Data

We are now talking with bots online more than ever. The bots are of such quality that we could not differentiate a bot and an actual human. We have had a lot of conversation with an English bot, so now its our turn as well as our responsibility to create a bot in our mother tongue, Nepali.

To create a efficient bot, we will be needing a high quality data. So, we are crowd sourcing to create a Nepali Chat bot dataset.

You can track our progress on data collection [here](https://github.com/itsmeashutosh43/create-a-Open-Source-Nepali-Chat-corpus-).
